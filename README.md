#### Avoid having a GitHub Profile that makes you look like a Bot!

When it comes to your GitHub profile, it's essential to strike a balance between showcasing your skills, projects, and contributions while maintaining professionalism and privacy. Here are some dos and don'ts for what information to include on your GitHub profile.

**Do:**
1. **Professional Profile Picture:** Use a professional photo or avatar that represents you well in a work context.

1. **Bio/Description:** Write a brief, informative bio that highlights your expertise, interests, and contributions. Keep it concise and relevant.

3. **Repositories:** Publicly showcase your best projects, contributions, and code samples. Organise them with clear descriptions and README files.

4. **Contributions:** Highlight your contributions to open-source projects and collaborations. This demonstrates your engagement and expertise within the developer community.

5. **Skills:** Include a list of relevant skills and technologies you're proficient in. This helps others quickly assess your expertise.

6. **Contact Information:** Optionally, provide ways for others to reach out to you, such as an email address or social media profiles.

7. **Open Source Contributions:** Mention any open-source projects you maintain or actively contribute to. This showcases your commitment to collaboration and community building.


**Don't:**
1. Sensitive Information: Avoid including sensitive personal information such as your home address, phone number, or personal email address.

1. C**onfidential Code:** Refrain from uploading proprietary or confidential code to public repositories. Be mindful of intellectual property rights and confidentiality agreements.

1. **Incomplete or Untidy Repositories:** Keep your repositories organised and well-documented. Avoid leaving unfinished or messy projects on your profile.

1. **Unprofessional Content:** Refrain from sharing content that could be considered offensive, discriminatory, or unprofessional. Remember that your GitHub profile is a reflection of your professional image.

1. **Overly Personal Details**: While it's fine to mention hobbies or interests, avoid oversharing personal details that are unrelated to your professional profile.

1. **Negative Remarks:** Avoid making negative remarks about previous employers, colleagues, or projects. Maintain a positive and constructive tone in your interactions and contributions.

1. **Inactive or Outdated Content:** Regularly update your profile with recent projects and contributions. Avoid leaving outdated or inactive content that doesn't reflect your current skills and expertise.
